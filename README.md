# 🌐 My Portfolio

Hey 👋 this is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my work as a **MERN stack developer**.  
I built it mainly with React and styled it to be clean, modern, and full of little animations that make it stand out.  
It’s also fully responsive, so it looks good on any device.

## ✨ What’s inside
- A nice interactive hero section (try moving your cursor 😉)  
- About me section where I talk a bit about who I am  
- Projects section with details about the apps I’ve built  
- Contact form that actually works so people can reach out  
- Fully responsive design that adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop

## 🛠 Tech I used
- **React** for the frontend  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**  
- **CSS / TailwindCSS** for styling and animations  
- **Node.js + Express** (backend planned for future updates)  
- **MongoDB** (for future blog/contact integration)  
- Deployed on **Vercel**
